Hello!

As a person considering to apply to the PhD program in EECS at MIT, we invite you to join us for a “webinar” conversation on Monday, Nov. 22nd from 3:30-5:00pm EST. This email is to ask you to “save-the-date”.

We are eager to chat with you about all kinds of things! Like what is a PhD degree and how do you get one, why should you get one, what will life be like while you are working towards a PhD degree, and much more! We hope you will take 90 minutes out of your day to join us in conversation!

Our speakers will include a number of our EECS department leaders (Department Head Asu Ozdaglar and AI+D Faculty Head Antonio Torralba), EECS alumni and current PhD students. 

We are presently working out the technical details of our conversation and will send a formal invitation very soon.

Until then, be well, stay safe and take care.
See you soon! 

Prof. Leslie Kolodziejski
Graduate Officer, Chair of Graduate Admissions, Professor of Electrical Engineering
EECS at MIT

PS: we apologize for the inconvenience of various different time zones.
