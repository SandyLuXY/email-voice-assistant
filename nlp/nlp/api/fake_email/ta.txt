	Dear all,
We are glad to inform you all that the Teaching Assistant Supervision Committee (TASC) mailbox (ji-tasc@sjtu.edu.cn) is now open to receive suggestions and complaints for all Teaching Assistant related issues.
The TASC responds to anonymous complaints and reports from students regarding their TAs. Based on the level of severity of the case, the TASC either directly forward the feedback/report to the faculty supervisor or investigate the case and take further actions (possibly punishments). The ultimate goal of the TASC is to apply appropriate supervision onto TAs and improve the level of teaching and quality of service for all TAs at the JI. The TASC build bridges between students, TAs and instructors. Part of TASC’s mission is to reassure students to feel safe to provide feedback for their TAs.
This mailbox not only responds to complaints regarding a particular TA's misconduct (canceling recitation classes/office hours without informing students, unfair grading, sharing students’ work without their permission and other unprofessional behavior), but also serves to promote communication between instructors, TAs and students. Unless permitted by the student, his/her identity will be protected and not disclosed to people outside of TASC. Once a report is received, members of TASC will investigate the TA’s behavior. If there is a violation of regulation, TASC will decide on the appropriate disciplinary actions against the TA.
If you have any questions on responsibilities of TASC, or complaints/suggestions for a particular TA that you hesitate to share with the TA or the course instructor in person, please email us at at ji-tasc@sjtu.edu.cn. We are happy to help.
Best regards,
