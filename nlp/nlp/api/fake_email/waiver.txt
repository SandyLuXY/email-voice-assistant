Dear Engine Consortium Member,

Thank you for opting into the consortium! We hope your fall semester is going well and that you have started to think about your plans for next academic year. We are writing today to remind you that deadlines for Fall 2022 admissions consideration at Northeastern University’s College of Engineering are quickly approaching. Students interested in applying for Ph.D. consideration should apply by December 15th, and students interested in applying for MS consideration should apply by January 15th.  More information on deadlines and requirements may be found on our admissions page.
If you still have questions about programmatic fit or curriculum, we would encourage you to take advantage of some of our resources that can help you make your decision on your program:
•	Our College of Engineering departments and programs have all recently presented webinars for admitted and prospective students. You may explore those recordings on Youtube.
  
•	We invite you to connect with our Student Ambassador Team at coeambassadors@listserv.neu.edu. In one email, you will contact 20 diverse, current graduate students in a variety of engineering programs. Feel free to explore to their website  to learn more about their experiences in the program through their blogs, chats, and videos.
  
•	We understand that all of our applicants and prospective students may have questions about the admissions process. Explore common questions on our FAQ page for assistance with your application.
  
•	The Graduate Admissions Team for the College of Engineering is happy to assist you. If you have questions about Northeastern or the admissions process, you may feel free to respond to this email or send a separate email to coe-graadmissions@northeastern.edu. 
Finally, as an Engine Consortium member, we want to remind you that you are eligible for application fee-waiver. To use the application fee-waiver, follow all application procedures. When you come across the Admissions Office Communication field on the Application Information tab, please enter the code ENGINE2022. Once you arrive at the payment page, select check as your payment to avoid the credit card fee. Both of these actions will allow you to submit your application with a waiver of the fee. 

Best,
Graduate Admissions Team
College of Engineering
